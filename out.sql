Rainer fellow in 2012. Mulago’s reasons for investing: “Off.Grid sells solar electricity – not equipment – to households in Africa. They install their own hardware and software in a customer''s home and then charge their customer for energy use via a mobile payment system. This is the first credible energy company we''ve seen targeting very poor people with a high quality, household lighting product they can afford.”',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

Rainer fellow in 2012. Mulago’s reasons for investing: “Poor people over-exploit their fisheries because they see no other way to feed their families. In Madagascar, Blue Ventures uses small, short-term fishery closures to show coastal communities how management can improve catch and increase incomes. Once people are convinced, Blue Ventures helps them establish locally managed marine areas that become part of a larger system of sustainable coastal fisheries. This straightforward approach creates a link between local economic benefits for fishermen and reef conservation. It is well suited to replication by a range of conservation organizations. Blue Ventures is gearing up to make that happen.”',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

Rainer fellow in 2009. Mulago’s reasons for investing: “Most poachers in Africa are smallholder farmers struggling to feed their families. Poor training and bad soil leads to low crop yields and cycles of hunger. COMACO trains farmers in high-productivity "conservation farming," buys their produce, and makes value-added food products to sell in African supermarkets. Across the 80,000 square kilometers of Zambia''s Luangwa Valley, more than 500,000 people are better off and wildlife numbers are stable or improving. COMACO is a rare example of successful large-scale market-based conservation.”',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)

Rainer fellow in 2013. Mulago’s reasons for investing: “The buildings where the poor go for services are almost always poorly designed and badly built. There is a huge opportunity for impact-driven design to drive better outcomes. For example, patients in hospitals benefit enormously from design features that increase ventilation, light and comfort. Over time, we want to see good design become the norm, and MASS is the industry leader best able to make that happen.”',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL)
