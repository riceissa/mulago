Educate Girls,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/educate-girls,$1.4 million unrestricted grants,2013,2013,"India has a public mandate to provide schools and primary education for all children, yet over 3.7 million eligible girls remain at home. Educate Girls mobilizes communities – parents, village leaders, schools, community volunteers – to enroll girls, improve school infrastructure (toilets, clean water, fencing) and boost learning outcomes. Since 2007, they have enrolled and retained 80,000 out-of-school girls in 8,000 schools across Rajasthan at a cost of less than $300 per school per year. Their model works and has great potential to scale big through government, reaching millions of girls."
Educate!,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/educate,$350K unrestricted grants,2015,2015,"Across Africa, more than 7 million young people enter the labor market each year, but the formal sector – the supply of jobs – is small, and most people have to figure out a way to make a living on their own. Education systems do little to prepare them for that reality. In Uganda and Rwanda, Educate! trains secondary school students in leadership, entrepreneurship and workforce readiness. Students learn by doing: they start real businesses under the mentorship of successful local business people. Educate!’s goal is to make their training model part of national education systems, ensuring that vast numbers of kids come out of school with the skills they need to thrive."
PEAS,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/peas,$350K unrestricted grants,2015,2015,"In poor countries, a secondary school education can vastly increase lifetime earnings, yet fewer than 25% of kids get to go. For those who do make it, the quality of education is often bad: Teacher are absent, curriculum outdated, and classrooms overcrowded. PEAS builds and operates low-cost secondary schools in very underserved parts of Uganda and Zambia. Their network of schools gets poor kids into school and dramatically improves quality. PEAS wants to create a charter school movement to transform secondary school education across the continent. Their systems for school management can help turn the commitment and resources of African governments into a great secondary education for all."
STiR Education,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/stir-education,$400K unrestricted grants,2014,2013,"Teachers are key drivers of student learning, but teaching is in crisis: in Uganda, 84% of teachers report wanting to quit their job, and in India, 25% of teachers are absent daily. A student’s experience can be enhanced by access to textbooks, new school buildings, and uniforms, but a motivated teacher has a far greater effect on a child’s desire to learn than any combination of the above. STIR finds and supports motivated teachers in India and Uganda, helping them form powerful networks to improve their own teaching and contribute to a wider movement of excellence. These networks change teacher behavior -- ranging from attendance to time on task -- which can directly affect student learning. STIR is collecting rigorous evidence to demonstrate the link between teacher motivation and improved learning outcomes. If the results are positive, this model could reposition teachers as the solution instead of the problem."
Babban Gona,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/babban-gona,$50K unrestricted grants,2015,2014,"Nigeria’s youth population is surging and prospects for formal employment are dim. Most families live off small subsistence farms, but that will never work for younger people looking for a better life. Babban Gona turns subsistence farms into profitable businesses through access to good training, affordable capital, quality inputs, and better prices for their crops. Babban Gona in turn makes money from farmer services, loan interest, and crop marketing. As a for-profit, they’re able to tap the capital that can drive aggressive growth -- and perhaps spawn an industry that will make farming a profitable business for millions of smallholder farmers, not least for the young people who need livelihoods so badly."

BOMA Project,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/boma,$1M unrestricted grants,2013,2013,"Millions of families live in arid, low-productivity lands essentially cut off from the modern economy. BOMA helps the poorest women in those communities establish small businesses that sell local staples. In Northern Kenya, BOMA's work doubles incomes, increases savings and builds resiliency against the shocks that come with poverty and periodic drought. BOMA already covers a region bigger than Ireland, and, in partnership with the Kenyan government, will scale up dramatically in the coming years."
Komaza,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/komaza,$700K unrestricted grants,2008,2008,"Millions of Africans are stuck on semi-arid land that has little potential to earn them a decent livelihood. Africa's vast unmet demand for wood products poses a solution: Komaza helps poor families turn dry, fallow land into small-scale, income-generating tree farms. This innovative, plausibly profitable social enterprise has the potential to stem deforestation and transform the lives of millions of smallholder farmers."
Komaza,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/komaza,$1.5 million convertible debt,2008,2008,"Millions of Africans are stuck on semi-arid land that has little potential to earn them a decent livelihood.

Mountain Hazelnuts,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/mountain-hazelnuts,$500K equity,2014,,"Mountain Hazelnuts takes a systemic approach to creating reliable income generation opportunities for Bhutan's poorest families while restoring ecosystem health and maintaining community cohesion. Their fully integrated nut company connects smallholder farmers to international markets, more than doubling farm income. As Bhutan's first 100% foreign direct investment enterprise, Mountain Hazelnuts' market-based approach and unique partnership with the government sets a standard for future investment in the country, one that serves its people, environment and public institutions."
myAgro,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/myagro,$1.15M unrestricted grants,2011,2011,"Farm incomes are cyclical and when planting time comes, farmers often don't have the cash to buy inputs like seeds and fertilizer. In Mali and Senegal, myAgro uses the ubiquity of mobile phones to help farmers save: when they have a little cash, farmers can buy cards just like they do for mobile airtime and text the money into a layaway account. At planting time, they get high-quality inputs and the training to use them, allowing them to double incomes. This is a model that could work for smallholder farmers in settings well beyond western Africa."
One Acre Fund,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/one-acre-fund,$2.9 million unrestricted grants,2007,2006,"Most of the world's poorest people are smallholder farmers. One Acre Fund gets them what they need -- training, seeds, fertilizer, credit and access to markets -- to make a better living from a small farm. Their bundled services have already reached a million people across four countries."
Proximity Designs,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/proximity,$2.9 million unrestricted grants,2007,2007,"Proximity designs and delivers affordable, income-lifting products and service – irrigation equipment, crop loans, and farm advisory services – to the rural poor in Myanmar. They “treat the poor as customers”: They design and develop in-country alongside those they serve and pay close attention to what people want. The result is a range of products and services that, on average, double customers’ income and are accessible to 80% of Myanmar’s rural population across 10,000+ villages."
Pula,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/pula-1,$50K unrestricted grant,2013,2012,"Pula gets agricultural insurance products to smallholder farmers. They help clients - seed and fertilizer companies, NGOs, financial institutions, and government programs - design and deliver insurance products that are bundled together with seeds, fertilizer and farm loans.  Input and crop yield insurance could be powerful risk mitigation tools in smallholder agriculture, particularly when coupled with Pula's farm advisory services."
Root Capital,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/root-capital,$2.15 million unrestricted grants,2010,,"Small and medium sized agricultural businesses are the backbone of any rural economy and the key to improving the incomes of smallholder farmers. Root Capital provides the working capital and market connections that are otherwise unavailable to these businesses in Africa and Latin America. Mulago is particularly interested in Root Capital's Frontier Portfolio with its emphasis on new markets, food security and nutrition."
VisionSpring,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/visionspring,$2.6 million unrestricted grants,2007,,"If you can't see, you can't work or learn. VisionSpring gets reading and prescription glasses to people who otherwise wouldn't have access to them, allowing people to regain lost livelihoods and live better lives. VisionSpring has improved the lives of over 1 million people -- an outstanding example of successful distribution of high-impact products to the poor. They lead the Mulago portfolio in the number of real beneficiaries and the increased beneficiary income per donor dollar."
Amani Global Health,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/amani-global-health,$200K unrestricted grants,2016,2016,"Amani Global Works is building a primary health system to provide quality care in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, starting with Idjwi (population 300,000), an island in Lake Kivu between DRC and Rwanda.  It’s a place in desperate need of primary care: families average 8.5 children, one of the highest rates in the world, and life expectancy is 25 years.  Amani's system has three main elements: well-managed clinics; proactive community health workers; and a high-quality referral hospital that works seamlessly with clinics and health workers.  Amani's results in Idjwi can influence the re-emerging health system in eastern DRC."
D-Rev,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/d-rev,$1.5 million unrestricted grants,2008,2010,"D-Rev designs world-class, affordable health products for the poor and uses established distribution networks to get them to the people who need them. Their flagship products -- a prosthetic knee and a suite of jaundice treatment devices -- are 1/10th the price of comparable products in the market, and work better."
Development Media International,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/development-media-international,$950K unrestricted grants,2013,,"DMI uses intensive media campaigns to drive life-saving behavior. By saturating markets with clever radio spots and talk shows, DMI is able to reach a national audience deeply enough to change cultural norms and make a lasting difference. A three-year rigorous study in Burkina Faso showed that their programming drives up demand for essential health services and saves kids’ lives at very low cost. Media is one of the most scalable interventions we know of and DMI is one of the best at using it to achieve social change."
EarthEnable,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/earthenable,$350K unrestricted grants,2015,2015,"Nearly 80% of Rwandans live on dirt floors. Dirt floors are teeming with bugs, parasites, and bacteria that make kids sick: A study from Mexico showed that concrete floors reduced child diarrhea by 49%! Concrete floors are too expensive, though, so EarthEnable has come up with a sealed earthen floor that Rwandan families can afford. The materials are local and community masons can be trained to install high-quality floors that will last. People love them: an EarthEnable floor means less dust, fewer bugs and a cleaner, warmer home. EarthEnable floors represent a breakthrough product that could improve the day-to-day lives – and health – of millions."
Healthy Kids/Brighter Future,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/healthy-kids-brighter-future,$150K unrestricted grants,2017,2017,"The health needs of school age children are still largely unmet across Africa.  Healthy Kids/Brighter Future tries to meet that need by turning school teachers into front-line health workers for low income kids. Preventable and treatable illnesses not only cause misery, they also have a direct effect on school attendance and mental development.  Healthy Kids/Brighter Future has a simple and effective solution with the potential to scale up via the Ministry of Education."
Integrate Health,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/integrate-health,$400K unrestricted grants,2016,2016,"Integrate Health has created a scalable primary health care solution in Togo - a country that has been largely ignored by the international aid community. There are three main elements: Clinics are tuned up, community health workers actively seek out sick kids, and health workers in both community and clinic work seamlessly as a single unit for detection, treatment, and follow-up."
Last Mile Health,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/last-mile-health,$1.8 million unrestricted grants,2012,2011,"Clinic-based health services have failed to reach the world’s most remote settings. Patients in these areas are often too sick for community health workers and too far from doctors. In Liberia, Last Mile Health recruits community members as ""Frontline Health Workers"" who are trained and equipped to treat a broad range of conditions. Well-trained, well-supplied and well-managed, these community health professionals achieve phenomenal results at low cost. In 2016, the government adopted a community health workforce program based on Last Mile Health’s model. The Frontline Health Worker model could revolutionize the role of the community health worker in remote settings worldwide."
Living Goods,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/living-goods,$2.65 million unrestricted grants,2007,,"We have solutions -- like malaria medication -- that save lives, but these products do little good if they don't reach the people who need them most. Living Goods solves this challenge with an Avon Lady-like network of dynamic women who sell high-impact health products and deliver health education door-to-door in their communities. The result has been a 25% decrease in child mortality in the communities where Living Goods works."
Medic Mobile,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/medic-mobile,$1.65 million unrestricted grants,2009,2009,"Medic Mobile allows community health workers to stay connected to clinics using cheap cell phones. Community health workers and clinics use Medic's software to do things like register pregnant women, promote childhood immunizations, track disease outbreaks, and keep medicines in stock -- all areas where they have evidence that mobile makes a real difference. Medic Mobile gets the right tools to the right partners to improve health for people in hard-to-reach communities."
mothers 2 mothers,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/mothers2mothers,$1.8 million unrestricted grants,2010,,"Significant progress has been made over the last decade towards the elimination of pediatric AIDS. But every day, almost 700 children are still infected with HIV primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Working alongside a clinical health system, mothers2mothers hires HIV+ mothers to educate and support pregnant HIV+ women through pregnancy, childbirth and early motherhood. Their peer-to-peer approach keeps women on anti-retroviral drugs, suppressing the virus and significantly reducing its transmission from mother to child. Mothers2mothers is now teaching other organizations -- ministries of health and big NGOs -- how to adapt and use the model in their own settings."
Muso,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/muso,$1.05M unrestricted grants,2013,2013,"The major killers of children - malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea – can be cured easily if treated immediately. Muso makes it happen by 1) mobilizing communities to report sick kids, 2) ensuring rapid ""doorstep care"" by community health workers, and 3) taking kids who need referral directly to the clinic. In Mali Muso dropped child mortality in a community of 11,000 people by an astonishing 90%. Muso's innovations could provide a huge boost to many government health worker systems."
Noora Health,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/noora-health,$400K unrestricted grants,2014,2014,"In poor countries, families play a much bigger role in health care for their loved ones, both in the hospital and after they have gone home. The failure to engage them leads to worse outcomes for the patient and represents a huge waste of potential. Noora Health combines video-based lessons with in-person practice so family members learn what they need to know to take care of their loved ones. They focus on things like wound care, simple physical therapy and proper medication dosing. This is a simple, low-cost, train-the-trainer model that has impact; they have seen a spectacular 71% reduction in post-surgical complications, especially infections. Noora is now testing the application of their caregiver training approach to other specialties in both public and private hospital settings in India."
One Heart Worldwide,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/one-heart-worldwide,$1.85 million unrestricted grants,2010,2009,"In too much of the world, maternal and newborn death rates are appallingly high, and there are simple ways to prevent them. One Heart Worldwide works with governments to create an efficient and systematic way to upgrade basic government birth centers, train providers well, and get women into prenatal care and safe delivery. In Baglung, a Nepalese district of 300,000 people, the maternal mortality rate dropped 90% in three years. One Heart is now poised to scale this success, with a viable plan to reach all the highest-need districts in Nepal by 2025."
PanTheryx,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/pantheryx,$500K equity,2015,,"Diarrhea is a scourge. It stunts kids’ growth and is a killer second only to pneumonia. Antibiotics don’t help in most cases, and It’s hard for mothers to prevent deadly dehydration. PanTheryx has developed an ingenious product that binds disease-causing microbes in the gut and flushes them away. Their product, called DiaResQ®, is cheap and easy to use. Pantheryx was recently named in the Reimagining Global Health report as one of the 30 leading healthcare innovations. PanTheryx could be a game-changer in the fight against a persistent killer."
Saha Global,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/saha-global,$200K unrestricted grants,2016,2016,"Saha Global works with women in Northern Ghana to set up water treatment businesses that sell affordable, clean water.  In the region where Saha works, communities drink water collected from big, open and dirty ponds.  Saha is one of the few water organizations that is able to change this ingrained behavior for hard-to-reach rural populations.  We love that Saha is truly committed to making it easy and affordable for poor families to exclusively drink clean water."
Sanergy,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/sanergy,$700K unrestricted grants,2012,2011,"Disease spreads rapidly in settings like slums that lack hygienic sanitation. Diarrheal disease alone kills 1.6M children every year. Sanergy has taken a system approach to solving this problem, from designing and franchising a great toilet facility to collecting the waste and converting it into products like fertilizer and energy. Sanergy is focused on making hygienic sanitation a community-wide behavioral norm and, as far as we know, is the only kind of solution that has the potential to solve the health crisis."
Sanku,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/sanku,$200K unrestricted grants,2016,2016,"Sanku equips small flour mills in East Africa with foolproof equipment to add micronutrients to maize consumed by poor families.  Starchy foods, a staple for poor families, are devoid of micronutrients critical to physical and mental development.  Sanku designed, distributes and services a machine that attaches to small local mills and doses pre-mixed micronutrients at no added cost.  Fortification at small mills across Africa means kids will have a better chance of reaching their full physical and intellectual potential."
StrongMinds,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/strongminds,$750K unrestricted grants,2014,2013,"Depression is currently the number one cause of disability in the world. An African woman suffering from depression makes less money, and her physical health – and the health of her children – is worse. StrongMinds tackles depression with a proven intervention in Uganda. They use a proven 12-week group talk-therapy approach to treat women and prevent future episodes of depression. In 2014, StrongMinds replicated the outstanding impact of the academic study that inspired its launch: 94% of women were free of depression symptoms at the end of their program. This low-cost, easy-to-replicate model holds promise to restore many women and their families to healthy, productive and satisfying lives."
VillageReach,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/villagereach,$2.45 million unrestricted grants,2008,,"Too often, health systems in poor countries can't reach the 'last mile' with life-saving health services. VillageReach puts high-performance logistics, human resource and inventory management systems in place to ensure that vaccines, medicines, and supplies get to the people who need them most. Their flagship project in Mozambique continues to deliver significant improvements in vaccinated children, dramatic reductions in drug stock-outs and reduced government operating costs. They're now a leading player in the international effort to prioritize and execute a re-design of vaccine supply chains across Africa."
WSUP,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/wsup,$800K unrestricted grants,2015,,"It's really hard to get sustainable water and sanitation services to the poor. Private sector solutions rarely reach the poorest people, and public sector services simply don't materialize. WSUP works with public and private service providers -- like municipal water utilities -- to demonstrate and scale up successful models that improve services for the lowest income people in the rapidly-growing cities of Africa and South Asia. While their model is complex, we have confidence that it is getting much better services -- at increasing scale -- to millions of people."
Inyenyeri,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/inyenyeri,$800K loans,2013,,"Indoor air pollution caused by bad cookstoves is a leading cause of lung disease and respiratory illness in poor countries. It turns out that only the best, ""forced-draft"" stoves reduce pollutants to a level low enough to improve health and save lives. The problem is that these stoves -- at ~$70 each -- are not affordable. Inyenyeri leases smokeless stoves to families for a nominal fee and sells biomass pellets to them at a cost that is lower than the charcoal they are already buying. This is the only scalable cooking solution we've ever seen that has the potential to improve health and even reduce deforestation."
Off.Grid:Electric,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/off-gridelectric,$300K equity,2012,2012,"Off.Grid sells solar electricity – not equipment – to households in Africa. They install their own hardware and software in a customer's home and then charge their customer for energy use via a mobile payment system. This is the first credible energy company we've seen targeting very poor people with a high quality, household lighting product they can afford."
Blue Ventures,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/blue-ventures,$950K unrestricted grants,2012,2012,"Poor people over-exploit their fisheries because they see no other way to feed their families. In Madagascar, Blue Ventures uses small, short-term fishery closures to show coastal communities how management can improve catch and increase incomes. Once people are convinced, Blue Ventures helps them establish locally managed marine areas that become part of a larger system of sustainable coastal fisheries. This straightforward approach creates a link between local economic benefits for fishermen and reef conservation. It is well suited to replication by a range of conservation organizations. Blue Ventures is gearing up to make that happen."
COMACO,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/comaco,$2.35 million unrestricted grants,2008,2009,"Most poachers in Africa are smallholder farmers struggling to feed their families. Poor training and bad soil leads to low crop yields and cycles of hunger. COMACO trains farmers in high-productivity ""conservation farming,"" buys their produce, and makes value-added food products to sell in African supermarkets. Across the 80,000 square kilometers of Zambia's Luangwa Valley, more than 500,000 people are better off and wildlife numbers are stable or improving. COMACO is a rare example of successful large-scale market-based conservation."
MASS Design Group,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/mass-design,$650K unrestricted grants,2014,2013,"The buildings where the poor go for services are almost always poorly designed and badly built. There is a huge opportunity for impact-driven design to drive better outcomes. For example, patients in hospitals benefit enormously from design features that increase ventilation, light and comfort. Over time, we want to see good design become the norm, and MASS is the industry leader best able to make that happen."
Nexleaf Analytics,https://mulagofoundation.org/Portfolio/nexleaf,$900K unrestricted grants,2013,2012,"Better data drives better decisions. Nexleaf uses cheap and reliable sensors on cell phones to capture real-time data -- from monitoring the temperature of vaccines to the emissions produced by cookstoves – that would otherwise be unavailable. With the right partners, this kind of data turns into better products, services, operations and then into impact."
